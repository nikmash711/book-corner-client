  - Has navbar similar to DownTheBlock that will change once logged in
2) Dashboard:
  - Grid of all books, search option and filter by category 
  - Each book shows: image, title, availability, place hold (if unavailable/not checked out by user/on hold by user already/user doesnt have more than 2 books checked out). Buttons shown are conditional 
  - Sidebar where user can see list of their currently checked out books, books on hold, overdue books + balance
4) On hold
5) Overdue/balance 
6)  Account Settings 

User Stories:
1) [x] User can check out books.
- Only 2 check outs at a time
- When user has 2 books checked out, the "check out" button no longer appears for them 
- User can see which books they currently have checked out under the "checked out" tab on the sidebar 

2) [x] User can place holds on a book 
- Max of 2 holds 
- Only if this book isnt already in their currently checked out
- Only if it's not already in their hold list 
- Only if it's unavailable
- User can see which books they have on hold under "on hold" 
- User can cancel hold if they want to

3) [x] User can see a history of checked out books 

4) Admin can see and manage requests, returns, holds 
[x] "Requests": Media that is checked out without a due date goes under "requests" so admin can prepare book and click "ready for pickup" (which will then email the user that their book is ready)
[x] "Checked Out": Media with a due date. Admin can change status of media (if user returns it) here. 
[x] Check if media being returned has a hold queue, make a request to '/availability/:mediaId/:userId' to return, and in the same async call, make a request to '/pickup/:mediaId' for the next user on the hold queue to get the book (and this will also consequently send an email to that user that their book is ready for pickup)

5) [] User can renew a media
- If they currently checked it out 
- It has a due date
- Cannot renew more than twice

6) [] Admin can add new media (title, type, and image)


Edge cases: 
- User puts book on hold, and then checks out 2 books, and then 3rd book becomes available

Bug: book goes into checkout history even when it is currently checked out. should only do this after its returned

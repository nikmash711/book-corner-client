[x]Admin can see and manage requests, returns, holds 
- [x] "Requests": Media that is checked out without a due date goes under "requests" so admin can prepare book and click "ready for pickup", which will then text the user that their book is ready. Admin can also cancel a request if need be. 
- [x] "Checked Out": Media with a due date. Admin can change status of media (if user returns it) here. 
- [x] Check if media being returned has a hold queue, make a request to '/availability/:mediaId/:userId' to return, and in the same async call, make a request to '/pickup/:mediaId' for the next user on the hold queue to get the book (and this will also consequently send a text to that user that their book is ready for pickup)

Fix/improve over future: 
- Bug: Balance still shows even after renewing, and shows 0

- Bug: after running app afer awhile, get "Unhandled Rejection (InvalidTokenError): Invalid token specified". Something goes wrong with token. Works upon refresh

- Make variables for scss window sizes so it stays constant 

- Fix font sizes

- What happens if book gets deleted. And its on hold? Checked out? etc? 

- Make tags for the different categories
Novels
Hashkafa
Halacha
Biographies
Kids Books
Kids DVD

- Make it more colorful, use flyer theme, icons, fonts 

- Show loading when communicating to server (buttons) and disable it once its clicked
 
- If admin deletes a book and I still see it, handle the error (if the book doesnt exist when checking out) 

- No media matches your search if empty 

- The icon doesn’t change when I edit the category … 

- Media form — when saving without putting in info, instead of preventing save, it errors

- Clear the error — I still see it when I go back to the book (can’t delete book, currently checked out) 

- Clear search bar if it gets deleted 

- The filter will say one thing, but the results will say another if something changes

- If passwords dont match tell them 

- Add a text for admin to see if the user has renewed the book or not 

- Allow user to cancel request and text admin (in both steps of process - whether its in mailbox or not). Cant allow user to cancel request bc thats like returning the book which will cause problems in cases of that media being on hold. Can only allow admin to do it.

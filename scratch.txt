User Stories:

3) [x] User can see a history of checked out books 

4) Admin can see and manage requests, returns, holds 
[x] "Requests": Media that is checked out without a due date goes under "requests" so admin can prepare book and click "ready for pickup" (which will then email the user that their book is ready)
[x] "Checked Out": Media with a due date. Admin can change status of media (if user returns it) here. 
[x] Check if media being returned has a hold queue, make a request to '/availability/:mediaId/:userId' to return, and in the same async call, make a request to '/pickup/:mediaId' for the next user on the hold queue to get the book (and this will also consequently send an email to that user that their book is ready for pickup)

5) [x] User can renew a media
- If they currently checked it out 
- It has a due date
- Cannot renew a given media more than once
- They can still renew it once if its overdue (?)
- Renews for 2 weeks

6) [] Admin can add new media (title, type, and image)

9) [] Admin can see and search directory of users with their info and if they have an outstanding balance

10) [] Admin can view all overdue media (along with name, balance, and info for the user who has currently checked it out)

Edge cases: 
- User puts book on hold, and then checks out 2 books, and then 3rd book becomes available

Bug: Balance still shows even after renewing, and shows 0

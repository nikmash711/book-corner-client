- option to renew should only be there if theres a due date (meaning ready for pickup)
- creating media needs: title, type, and image
- user can only place hold if a) media is unavailable and b) that user is not the one who has checked out that media c) hasnt placed hold already
if a book was returned and theres no hold queue, button says "book returned". if the book was returned and there is a hold queue, button should say "book was returned, ready for next user in hold queue"

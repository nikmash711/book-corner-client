[x]Admin can see and manage requests, returns, holds 
[x] "Requests": Media that is checked out without a due date goes under "requests" so admin can prepare book and click "ready for pickup" (which will then email the user that their book is ready)
[x] "Checked Out": Media with a due date. Admin can change status of media (if user returns it) here. 
[x] Check if media being returned has a hold queue, make a request to '/availability/:mediaId/:userId' to return, and in the same async call, make a request to '/pickup/:mediaId' for the next user on the hold queue to get the book (and this will also consequently send an email to that user that their book is ready for pickup)
[x] Balance is cleared when book is returned (is this problematic?)

Edge cases:

Bug: Balance still shows even after renewing, and shows 0

Bug: after running app afer awhile, get "Unhandled Rejection (InvalidTokenError): Invalid token specified". Something goes wrong with token. Works upon refresh

Need To Look Into: 
- Texting Sharon when book is checked out (https://www.nexmo.com/pricing)
- Node Mailer for resetting password (https://www.codementor.io/olatundegaruba/password-reset-using-jwt-ag2pmlck0)
- Deploying
